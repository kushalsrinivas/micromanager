# 🤖 The Micro Manager

A friendly AI productivity assistant that helps developers stay focused with gentle, encouraging check-ins throughout the day.

## ✨ Features

- **Smart Reminders**: Sends popup notifications every 5-10 minutes to check on your progress
- **Encouraging Feedback**: Provides positive reinforcement and motivation based on your responses
- **Progress Tracking**: Logs your check-ins with timestamps for productivity awareness
- **Customizable Messages**: Easy to modify reminder messages and responses
- **Non-Intrusive**: Simple yes/no dialogs that don't disrupt your workflow

## 🚀 How It Works

The Micro Manager runs in the background and periodically shows friendly popup messages asking about your progress. Based on your response:

- **Making Progress?** → Get encouraging messages like "Awesome! Keep up the excellent work! 🎉"
- **Need More Time?** → Receive motivational support like "That's okay! Every expert was once a beginner. You got this! 💪"

All interactions are logged with timestamps to help you track your productivity patterns.
